## Demo!
1. Say the concept of DevSecOps to your audiences with short words, and expain the demo platform and technical prerequisites.
2. Show [sample.yaml](https://github.com/hisashiyamaguchi/shift-left-secret/blob/main/.github/workflows/sample.yaml), and explain that the integration has been completed with just 2 lines!
3. Show [secret.tf](https://github.com/hisashiyamaguchi/shift-left-secret/blob/main/samples/secret.tf) - it has an AWS Key. Say that Orca is going to scan and identify the AWS Key, and stop the pipeline.
4. Clone the repo to your local laptop. Go the repo directory and chagen any codes - README.md is the easiest.
5. Commit the change locally and push the commit to remote repo - GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered, and start buiding and scanning terraform definition.
5. Orca Security is going to detect the source code secret policy violation, and the delivery pipeline will be red.
6. Visit Orca dashboard and show scanning logs - you can show red flag error logs.
